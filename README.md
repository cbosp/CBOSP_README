## Welcome to Cooperative Base Open Source Project (or CBOSP for short) ##

This is a small project founded by the creator of Vanilla (Skye)

For the past couple years I have been lost. No clue where to turn to to get a solid base to create a new ROM (hence why Vanilla has not seen the light of the day since Nougat.)

This project is intended to be just that for once android Q drops. It's for anyone who wants to create their own ROM but has no strong base. 

The Goals for this project are to provide a clean base aosp without deprecated sources and with the extra bug fixes Google does not provide us with. Upon booting CBOSP it should feel very similar to how a nexus 6p booted (without Gapps) 

We will also host a code review site for anyone willing to submit bug fixes and patches.

CBOSP should not be uploaded to XDA or any other ROM sharing website. (any ROM based off our ROM can upload it wherever just not our BASE ROM)

If you are going to build it and upload it... atleast change the name. Not like there is going to be any branding in the ROM.

If you use our base for your ROM do us a favor and credit us. We wont hunt you down if you don't give us credit but hey we are kind of doing this for people like you.

### Gerrit and Maintainers ###

As Android Q is not out yet we don't have much to say here. 

What we can say is we plan on hosting a Gerrit for people submit Bug Fixes, Patches and Maintain Devices

You might be asking yourself, What do you mean maintain devices? Well we plan on giving people the opportunity to support devices for CBSOP so that people can use confirmed booting device trees for their ROM. 

While yes we will not be posting this ROM to any website, we expect our maintainers to keep their devices up to date and booting for at the least every security patch. 

Anyone who wants to be a maintainer can apply once Android Q comes out.

### Featured ROMS Using CBOSP as a base ###

This will be our featured ROM section

Here, if you would like us to, we will add your ROM name and Github link/Forum link to show off your ROM in our source

### Credits ###

This section is to thank anyone who contributes to this project
